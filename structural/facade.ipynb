    "# Facade Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Facade Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use for clients. It acts as a \"facade\" or a single entry point to the underlying complexity, hiding the details and interactions of the subsystem from the client code. This pattern is useful when you want to provide a simple and unified interface to a set of complex classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of the Facade Design Pattern is to provide a high-level, easy-to-use interface that hides the complexities of a subsystem from clients. It simplifies the interaction with the subsystem, reducing the knowledge required by the client and making the subsystem more maintainable by decoupling it from the client code. The pattern promotes a more structured and organized way of accessing a complex set of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the Facade Design Pattern are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Facade**: This is the main class that acts as the entry point to the subsystem. It provides a simple interface that encapsulates the complexities of the underlying classes.\n",
    "2. **Subsystem Classes**: These are the complex classes that constitute the subsystem. The Facade delegates the client requests to the appropriate methods of these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Facade in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of a home theater system with multiple components like a DVD player, projector, and sound system. We'll use the Facade pattern to provide a simplified interface for turning on and off the entire home theater system.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the Facade class:"
