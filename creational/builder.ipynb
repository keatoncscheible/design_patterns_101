    "# Builder Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that focuses on creating complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. The pattern is particularly useful when there are many optional components in an object, and it provides a way to construct the object with only the required components, leaving out the optional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent\n",
    "The intent of the Builder Design Pattern is to abstract the construction of complex objects, making the construction process more flexible and reusable. It allows the client code to create different representations of an object without being concerned about the construction steps or the order in which they are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "The main components of the Builder Design Pattern are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product**: This is the complex object that we want to create.\n",
    "2. **Builder**: The abstract interface that defines the construction steps required to build the product.\n",
    "3. **ConcreteBuilder**: ConcreteBuilder classes implement the Builder interface to construct and assemble the product. Different ConcreteBuilder classes can produce different representations of the product.\n",
    "4. **Director**: The Director class controls the construction process using a Builder object. It guides the construction steps and ensures that the product is built correctly.\n",
    "5. **Client**: The client code interacts with the Director to construct the product. It is not aware of the specific construction steps or the product's internal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Builder in Python\n",
    "Let's consider an example of building a computer, where the computer can have different configurations. We will use the Builder pattern to create different types of computers step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the Product:"
